[STUBA/Y1SS/OOP] XSS Alarm Simulation System

eXpress Security Simulator (XSS) is a school-related alarm simulation application.
It uses custom made Java object-stream-based communication between server and the client console.
System also provides ability to connect physical sensors using simple byte-based message protocol.

 * xss-server is server application that needs to be running
 * xss-core-lib contains core classes required both for client and server
 * xss-hbm-lib containts Hibernate persistence framework mapping files to describe database objects
 * xss-console contains client console used to connect to server for purpose of monitoring and configuration
 * xss-arduino-physens-pir is an example of Arduino-based physical sensor board (used with PIR motion sensor)
 
THIS PROJECT IS ONLY A SCHOOL-ASSIGNMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND IS NOT DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTION USE.
